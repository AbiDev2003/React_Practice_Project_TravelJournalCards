## üìÅ React-tree Structure

```mermaid
    graph TD
    App.jsx
    App.jsx --> ./components/Header.jsx
    App.jsx --> ./components/Entry.jsx
    ./components/Entry.jsx --> ./components/data.js
```

## How It Works

#### Component Reusability
- Each location card is a reusable component which is called Entry.jsx.
- We take data by mapping over data.js and pass it as a prop to Entry.jsx. 
- Entry.jsx is being imported to App.jsx to make it display on the page.
